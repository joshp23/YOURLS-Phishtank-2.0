# YOURLS-Phishtank-2.0

#### An anti-spam blacklist-check for YOURLS using the Phishtank API

Phishtank 2.0 for YOURLS is a functiolnal rewrite of the old phishtank plugin, which seems abondoned. There are some noticable additions to the code.

### Features
1. This plugin will check URL submissions against [Phishtanks's](https://www.phishtank.com/) blacklist, and it will block any blacklisted submissions.
2. This plugin will re-check old links when they are clicked to see if they have been blacklisted since 1st submitted.
3. You can set an option in the admin section to keep old links that are found to be bad, redirecting the user to a warning page, or you can just have bad links deleted when discovered in the blacklist.
4. You can customize the danger.php to offer any warning you see fit.
5. You can set an option in the admin section to add your Phishtank API key, if you have one.
6. Uses base64 instead of urlencode to send url to Phishtank

### Requirements
1. A working YOURLS installation
2. A Phishtank API key (optional, strongly reccomended if you anticipate high volume)

### Installation
1. Download, extract, and copy the phishtank-2.0 folder to your YOURLS/user/plugins/ folder
2. Enable Phishtank 2.0 in the "Manage Plugins" page under the Admin section of YOURLS
3. Visit the new Options page for Phishtank, enter in your API key, make your choice regarding dirty old links.
4. Have Fun!
